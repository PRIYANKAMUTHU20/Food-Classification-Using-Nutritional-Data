# Food-Classification-Using-Nutritional-Data
NutriClass: Food Classification Using Nutritional Data
A machine learning project that classifies food items based on their nutritional content
Workflow:
Data Exploration & Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the dataset to understand distributions, class balance, and relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, capped the outliers, and scaled numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Applied One Hot Encoding and Label Encoder for the conversion of categorical to numerical values.
Model Training & Evaluation: Trained and compared multiple classification algorithms:
                             Logistic Regression
                             Decision Tree
                             Random Forest
                             K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
                             Support Vector Machine (SVM)
                             XGBoost
                             Gradient Boosting Classifier
Results & Analysis: Evaluated models based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix
